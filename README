Dynamical Modeling of Fault Slip Rates at the New Zealand Plate Boundary Indicates Fault Weakness

This repository contains code and data associated with Hirschberg & Sutherland (submitted).

The code used for the model inversion is from Haines & Sutherland (2018) and the user is referred to their paper for inversion codes.
Codes relating to parameter adjustment are present in the 'code' folder.

Data input into the models and data output by the models are present in the 'data' folder.
Slip rate data is from Seebeck et al. (2023). Topography data derives from Mitchell et al. (2012).
